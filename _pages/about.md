I am currently a final-year master student from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Yuanzheng Li](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085523933). My research interest lie broadly in machine learning, optimization for renewable power systems operation, with a special focus on wind power forecast.

<!-- Recently, I am developing structured neural network-based controllers with provably guarantees on stability and steady-state efficiency for large-scale systems. I’m also working on efficient algorithums to overcome the challenges on sample complexity and explorations in learning for real-world applications (e.g., power systems). -->
